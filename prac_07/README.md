# CP1404 Practicals

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions and exercises for the CP1404 subject â€“ "Programming II" at James Cook University.  
The practicals cover object-oriented programming, file input/output, clean code practices, and software design concepts in Python.

## What I've Learned About Clean Code

- Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Keep functions short, focused, and responsible for a single task (Single Responsibility Principle).
- Write readable code with proper indentation, spacing, and helpful comments or docstrings.
